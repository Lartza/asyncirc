# lagirc
a simple asyncio irc library

Twisted was not ported for Python 3, and all other irc libraries had stuff I didn't like.
And so was this library born...

It is heavily inspired by Twisted and pydle, to name a few.

A example of using the library can be found at https://github.com/Lartza/lagbot
